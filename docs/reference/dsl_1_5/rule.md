# rule schema fields

Contract source: [rule.schema.json](../../../gisela/contracts/v1_5/rule.schema.json)

This page is an extraction of the public JSON schema for DSL 1.5. Schema acceptance, semantic admission, and runtime execution are different checks.

## Root structure

| Field path | Required at its parent | Declared type | Explicit constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | yes | string | maxLength: 96; pattern: ^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(?:[._-][a-z0-9]+)*$ |  |
| trigger | yes | Reference to trigger |  |  |
| when | no | Reference to condition |  |  |
| effects | yes | array | minItems: 1 |  |
| enabled | no | boolean |  |  |

type: "object"

additionalProperties: false

## Validation boundary

- Structural status: grounded in the linked schema.
- Semantic status: requires package admission against the public validator.
- Runtime status: requires an executable example using the public session API.
- Any behavior not supported by those sources remains not established.
